Li-Fi Is A Technology That Uses The Light Emitting Diodes To Transmit The Data Wirelessly

Abstract— 
Whether we are using wireless internet in a coffee shop, stealing it from the guy next door, or competing for bandwidth at a conference, you’ve probably gotten frustrated at the slow speeds you face when more than one device is tapped into the network. As more and more people and their many devices access wireless internet, clogged airwaves are going to make it. One German physicist ,DR. Harald Haas, has come up with a solution he calls ―Data Through Illuminationǁ—taking the fibre out of fibre optics by sending data through an LED light bulb that varies in intensity faster than the human eye can follow. It’s the same idea behind infrared remote controls, but far more powerful. Haas says his invention, which he calls D-Light, can produce data rates faster than 10 megabits per second, which is speedier than your average broadband connection. He envisions a future where data for laptops, Smartphone’s, and tablets is transmitted through the light in a room. 

INTRODUCTION 

1) Li-Fi Is A Technology That Uses The Light Emitting Diodes To Transmit The Data Wirelessly.

 2) HARALD HAAS, who is considered to be the father of Li-Fi from University of Edinburgh.

 3) Li-Fi Is Fast And Cheap Optical Version Of Wi-Fi , Based On Visible Light Communication(VLC);

 4) VlC Is A Data Communication Medium, Which Uses The Visible Light Between 400 Thz (780 Nm) And 800 Thz (375 Nm) As Optical Carrier For Data Transmission.

 5) Light is inherently safe and can be used in places where radio frequency communication is often deemed problematic, such as in aircraft cabins or hospitals. So visible light communication not only has the potential to Solve the problem of lack of spectrum space, but can also enable novel application. The visible light spectrum is unused; it's not regulated, and can be used for communication at very high speeds.
